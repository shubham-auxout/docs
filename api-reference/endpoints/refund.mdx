# Refund API

The Refund API allows you to return funds to a customer for a previously settled transaction. You can process full refunds or partial refunds as needed.

<Note>
  For transactions that have been authorized but not yet settled, use the [Void API](/api-reference/endpoints/void) instead for a faster cancellation process.
</Note>

## API Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/public/refund
```

## Request Parameters

<ParamField body="TransactionId" type="string" required>
  The ID of the transaction to refund (must be in a settled state)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Amount" type="number">
  The amount to refund. If omitted, the full transaction amount will be refunded.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Reason" type="string">
  Reason for the refund
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Metadata" type="object">
  Additional data to store with the refund record
</ParamField>

## Example Request - Full Refund
