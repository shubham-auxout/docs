# Void Transaction API

The Void Transaction API allows you to cancel a previously authorized transaction before it has been settled. This is typically used when a customer wants to cancel a purchase shortly after making it, or when an error was made during the transaction process.

<Note>
  Void operations can only be performed on transactions that have not yet been settled. For settled transactions, use the [Refund API](/api-reference/endpoints/refund) instead.
</Note>

## Void vs. Refund

<Accordion title="Understanding Void vs. Refund">
  <p>It's important to understand the difference between voiding a transaction and refunding a transaction:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Void</strong>: Cancels an authorization before it is settled. No funds have actually moved, so the customer will never see the charge on their statement. This is typically completed instantly.</li>
    <li><strong>Refund</strong>: Returns funds to a customer after a transaction has been settled. The customer will see both the original charge and the refund on their statement. This process typically takes 2-5 business days for the funds to be returned to the customer's account.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When possible, voiding is preferable to refunding because:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>It's faster for the customer</li>
    <li>It avoids processing fees associated with refunds</li>
    <li>It creates a cleaner customer experience (no charge appears on their statement)</li>
  </ul>
