The AuxVault API is a RESTful API that allows you to process financial transactions, manage customers, and access transaction data securely. This documentation provides detailed information about each endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and error handling.

## Base URLs

```
# Production Environment
https://api.auxvault.net

# Sandbox Environment (for testing)
https://dev-api.auxvault.net
```

<Note>
  Always use the sandbox environment for development and testing before moving to production.
</Note>

## API Versioning

The AuxVault API uses versioning to ensure backward compatibility as we add new features. The current version is `v1`.

All API requests should include the version in the URL path:

```
https://api.auxvault.net/api/v1/public/transaction
```

## Authentication

All API requests must include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Request Headers

| Header          | Required | Description                           |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes      | Your API key                          |
| `Content-Type`  | Yes      | Must be `application/json`            |
| `Accept`        | No       | Defaults to `application/json`        |

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A successful response will have a status code in the 2xx range and contain the requested data. Error responses will have a status code in the 4xx or 5xx range and include an error message.

### Success Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "transactionId": "txn_123456789",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "approved",
    "createdAt": "2025-07-03T06:15:23Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_card",
    "message": "The card number provided is invalid",
    "requestId": "req_abcdefg123456"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The AuxVault API implements rate limiting to protect against abuse. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute for standard accounts
- 300 requests per minute for enterprise accounts

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
