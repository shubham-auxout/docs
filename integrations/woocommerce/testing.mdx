## Sandbox testing
- Turn on Test Mode and use sandbox API URL/Key
- Test API Connection → success
- Fetch Configuration → confirm fee/processor settings load
- Place test orders: Credit Card, ACH, Text‑to‑Pay
- Confirm service fee (if enabled) and that Text‑to‑Pay orders auto-update after paying the SMS link
- Check logs for errors (WooCommerce → Status → Logs → auxpay-payment-gateway)

## Troubleshooting
- Payment method not showing: ensure it’s enabled under WooCommerce → Payments, and AuxPay API settings are valid
- Card/ACH fields missing: disable ad/script blockers; check site CSP
- Service fee not appearing: enable fee and ensure it’s active in AuxPay config; method must be Card or ACH
- Text‑to‑Pay not updating: confirm HTTPS public URL and webhook; check logs
- Refund not syncing: verify refund webhook is configured to your site URL
