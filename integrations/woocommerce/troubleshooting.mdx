# Troubleshooting

- Method not visible: Enable under WooCommerce → Payments and verify AuxPay API settings
- Fields missing: Disable ad/script blockers; check Content Security Policy
- Fee not showing: Fee must be enabled and active in AuxPay config; Card/ACH must be selected
- Text‑to‑Pay not updating: Ensure HTTPS and public reachability; verify webhook URLs; see Logs
- Refunds not syncing: Confirm refund webhook configured in AuxPay to your site URL

## Logs
- Enable Debug Logs in AuxPay settings
- View at WooCommerce → Status → Logs → source “auxpay-payment-gateway”
