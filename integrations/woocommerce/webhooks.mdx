# Webhooks

Your site must be publicly reachable over HTTPS.

## Text‑to‑Pay updates
- URL: `https://your-site.com/?wc-api=wc_auxpay_texttopay_webhook`
- When a customer pays via the SMS link, this webhook updates the order automatically.

## External refunds
- URL: `https://your-site.com/?wc-api=wc_auxpay_refund_webhook`
- When refunds originate outside WooCommerce (e.g., in AuxPay), this webhook creates a corresponding WooCommerce refund.

<Callout type="info">
If you use a staging domain, update webhook URLs accordingly.
