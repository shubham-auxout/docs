## Convenience/Service Fee (optional)
- Enable in WooCommerce → Settings → AuxPay (set fee title, e.g., “Technology Fee”).
- When enabled and active in your AuxPay configuration, a fee appears when the customer selects Credit Card or ACH.
- Calculation follows your AuxPay config (percent / fixed / minimum) and shows as a separate line item.

## Refunds from WooCommerce
- From the order details page, click Refund (full or partial) to send a refund to AuxPay.
- The order shows a note when the refund is submitted.

## Refunds from AuxPay (external)
- Configure the Refund webhook so WooCommerce reflects external refunds automatically. See Webhooks.
