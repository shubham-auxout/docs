# FAQ

**Does the plugin store card data?**
No. Card details are tokenized with hosted fields and never stored on your site.

**Can I charge a convenience fee?**
Yes. Enable it in AuxPay settings. The fee appears for Card/ACH when active in your AuxPay configuration.

**How do refunds work?**
You can refund from the WooCommerce order screen. External refunds from AuxPay can sync via the refund webhook.

**Is Text‑to‑Pay supported?**
Yes. Customers receive an SMS link after placing an order, and the order updates automatically upon payment.
